CSS Selectors

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

    [Simple selectors] (select elements based on name, id, class)
    [Combinator selectors] (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    [Pseudo-class selectors] (select elements based on a certain state)
    [ Pseudo-elements selectors ](select and style a part of an element)
    [ Attribute selectors] (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
----------------------------------------------------------------
In CSS there are five generic font families:

    Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
    Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
    Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
    Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
    Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
